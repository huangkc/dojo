						<p><strong>General rules of conduct<strong></p>
						​
						Aikido remains deeply influenced by traditional Japanese martial arts values (budo). A centerpiece is Rei, which means "appreciation and respect." Rei is shown to O-Sensei (Founder of Aikido), to the sensei (instructors), and to training partners.

						<p><strong>Bowing</strong></p>

						In the dojo (place of practice), respect is expressed in the form of bowing, as is done in traditional martial arts culture. Bowing in the dojo is a purely cultural, non-religious, expression of respect.

						A picture of O-Sensei and that of other late grand masters are displayed in the shomen (front of the dojo). Respect and gratitude to O-Sensei for his legacy are expressed in the form of bowing.

						<p>Bowing occurs on multiple occasions in the dojo, including:</p>

						<li>Upon entering or leaving the dojo: the bow is executed standing up, bare head, arms along the side of the body and facing towards the shomen.</li></br>
						
						<li>Upon stepping onto or off of the tatami (mats): kneel down in seiza (sitting on the heels with the back straight), and bow to the shomen with both hands on the mat in front of you. </li></br>

						<li>At the beginning and end of class: everybody will line up facing the shomen, sitting quietly; then bow together to the shomen and to the instructor.</li></br>
						
						<li>Before and after practicing with a training partner (during or after class): bow to each other in seiza.</li>

						<p><strong>Classes</strong></p>

						​The dojo opens about 15 minutes before the beginning of a class. If you wish only to observe a class, come in to the dojo and someone will greet you. Upon entering the dojo, remove your shoes in the front area (at the top of the steps). The day of your first class, allow for at least 15 minutes to register and get acquainted with the space.</br></br>

						Classes begin with warm-ups customized to the practice of Aikido or Iaido. Before class, take time to calm and settle yourself to prepare both physically and mentally for practice.</br></br>

						Do not be late. But if circumstances arise and you must arrive late to class, get changed as quickly as you can, stand by the edge of the mat, and wait for the instructor to acknowledge you, at which point you may bow onto the mat.

						<p><strong>Partners</strong></p>

						Better than adversaries, your partners are critical to your improvement and they are happy to help you if they are more advanced. Lacking respect towards your training partners goes against the spirit of Aikido and is unproductive. Remain humble and sincere. </br></br>

						During class or free practice, overcome your aggressiveness and competitiveness. Before and after practicing with a partner, show respect and bow to her/him.</br>
						
						<p><strong>Other expressions of respect</strong></p>

						There is more to respect than just bowing. The following is an indicative, not exhaustive, list of Reigi Saho practice in the dojo.</br></br>

						<li>Never practice with impaired faculties.</li></br>

						<li>Be fully aware and avoid casual training (this is also an injury risk factor).</li></br>
						
						<li>Keep still and silent during the bows at the start and end of classes.</li></br>

						<li>During class, communicate through your movements, rather than by chat, to preserve others' concentration.</li></br>

						<li>In the dressing room or off the tatami, do not be loud and do not distract those who practice.</li></br>

						<li>Have all nails cut short and remove any jewelry or anything sharp before stepping on the tatami.</li></br>

						<li>Take good care of your personal hygiene and use a clean gi (uniform) every day at the dojo.</li></br>

						<li>If you tend to sweat a lot, wear a T-shirt, and insert a towel in your gi to dry your face.</li></br>

						<li>Place your shoes in an orderly manner, not blocking the way to others.</li>

						<p><strong>Dojo Tasks<strong></p>

						The dojo has no employees. The dojo needs to be maintained and kept immaculately clean. This is every member's responsibility. Tatami need special care and must be cleaned at least once a day, usually after class. All members are expected to help keep all parts of the dojo neat and orderly at all times--including the mat, floors, entrance area, bathrooms, and inside the locker rooms. No permission is required to help with cleaning. Observe and ask questions to the sensei or senior students, who will be happy to guide you through the cleaning process.
