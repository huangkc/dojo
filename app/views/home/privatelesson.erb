Private Lessons
People learn in a variety of styles and rhythms. Private lessons offer a different learning environment than group lessons. Students report a diverse set of benefits:

Focused attention from the teacher on your particular needs.
Quiet environment with minimal distraction.
Flexibility to repeat one movement until satisfied.
Opportunity for more-self-directed learning.
Safe environment to explore "what your body can do."
Convenience of scheduling.
Lessons are tailored to the needs of the student. Instruction may include balance exercises, use of eyes, breath, refinement of upper and lower body coordination,  falling and rolling, utilizing ground forces, practice of empty-handed aikido techniques, sword, bokken or jo work. Some people choose private lessons as an alternative to group classes. For many aikido students, a combination of private lessons along with regular group classes promotes accelerated progress.

" I love working with all different kinds of people. We can work anywhere along the spectrum; from dynamic martial movement to the subtleties of breathing. Whether you consider yourself to be in shape or out of shape, injured or training for top performance, we begin with what you can do comfortably, then refine and build your repertoire." -Suzane Van Amburgh
