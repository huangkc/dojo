      <!-- <h5 class='center'> ADULT PROGRAM </h5> -->
      
â€‹      <p>Aikido is a dynamic, physical martial art that emphasizes fluidity and continuity of motion without sacrificing power. Aikido is practiced by men and women, young and old, and requires no exceptional fitness level to begin learning. In an aikido class, you can expect to both perform techniques and to receive them from other students -- to take turns as "nage" and "uke."</p>

        <p>The adult program is comprehensive and dynamic and offers a curriculum suited for practitioners of all experience levels. A strong foundation in weapons training and fluid style of ukemi give students the tools to progress and practice Aikido at the highest level. As you train, you will begin to notice and appreciate how these techniques build on each other, and share common concepts and movements. ABC Aikido is a friendly environment in which to begin or continue training, as personal limits, boundaries, and injuries are always respected.</p>

        <p>Our class schedule is flexible and offers training options seven days a week. ABC Aikido members have access to unlimited Aikido classes and are encouraged to attend as many classes as they feel comfortable. All prospective students are welcome to watch and/or try one of our regular scheduled classes anytime.
