        <h5 class="light">Aikido is uniquely suitable as an effective method of self-defense because it is not based on muscle mass, strength or aggression. Its principles of absorption and redirection are designed to neutralize an attack and keep one out of harmâ€™s way.</h5>
        
        <h5 class="light">Aikido training also brings out the best tools for any effective self-defense making use of intellect, intuition and instinct and employing effective techniques that can be applied to someone of any size. If attacked anyone can often prevail by using any or all of the above skills. And using those combined skills is what all Aikido practice is about.</h5>

        <h5 class="light">The content and format of self-defense and other special training may be customized based on students' needs. Contact us for more information on the options we offer.	</h5>
