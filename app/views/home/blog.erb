        Aikido is a true Budo or “martial way.” Throughout the history of martial combat weapons have been utilized on the field of battle. It is therefore imperative to one’s martial training to foster an understanding of armed philosophy. The bokken (wooden sword) and jo (wooden staff) are employed to help demonstrate to students the essential elements of technique, such as proper timing, spacing, and an understanding of the line of attack.</br></br>

        Training in the weapons program is introduced immediately to new practitioners and is therefore not reserved to students of advanced rank or experience. In fact, we encourage our new practitioners to begin with a weapons class, as the progression to empty-hand techniques will then flow more logically and naturally.</br></br>

        Three principal weapons used in Aikido are the jo (staff), bokken (Japanese wooden sword) and tanto (knife). By training with weapons, students get a better understanding of general Aikido principles, such as ma-ai (proper distancing from an attacker), and moving off the line of attack.</br></br>

        Weapons classes are open to all adult members, including beginner Aikido students.
