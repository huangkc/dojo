    <!-- <h5 class="light">Training in Aikido principles include meditation, breathing, and ki development exercises.</h5> -->

    <p class="center"><strong>Meditation </strong></p>

    <p>Numerous prominent martial artists in Japanese history came to find in meditation practice a vital element that informed their practice. Meditation helps to cure or calm down the fever that man has been infected with throughout modern civilization, so that he or she can come to see the true-self and the quintessence of existing things. And most significantly, its value is found within simple practicality. Through this simple practice, we are led to the world where mechanically fixed, established values that often do not belong to us may be reversed from the bottom up. And thus, we are able to return human quality to its original purity and peace for the universal liberation of man.</p>

<!-- Indeed, many of the qualities needed in Aikido training—the fearlessness, energy and focus required to plumb the depths of one’s own existence in the midst of conflict—are demanded in Zen as well. When the dualistic separation of “self” and “other” is transcended through the forging of deep mind-body training, the concept of an opponent loses all meaning.  -->

<!-- It is important to cultivate the eyes to see that the substance is beyond forms, and to find true peace within tranquility of the mind. Only when this is thoroughly attained, paradoxically, are we not only able to see these forms in a positive light, but can we also bring to our lives many colorful flowers for our appreciation. As the Heart Sutra reads, “Form is exactly emptiness, emptiness is exactly form.” -->

    <p class='center'><strong>Ki Breathing </strong></p>

    <p>Breathing is something we all take for granted. Yet it is an experience we cannot do without for more than a few minutes. To breathe properly is to breathe with mind and body unified. Just as breathing is essential to sustaining life, it is also essential to developing our Ki and life power. Ki breathing is a central part of training and represents another opportunity to directly experience and realize for yourself the oneness of mind and body as well as your original connection to the Ki of the Universe.</p>

    <p class='center'><strong>Aikido Without Falling </strong></p>

    <p>Solo and partnered ki development exercises are not only essential to understanding Aikido techniques, but they also help students to experience mind and body awareness through movement without falling or throwing. A number of benefits are realized through this training, such as stress reduction as well as improved balance, posture, and mental and physical reflexes.

        <!-- <h5 class="light">Being calm in daily life can often be the difference between performing well and performing poorly. In extreme situations, it can even be the difference between life and death. Training in Aikido principles focuses on the methods of meditation, controlled breathing, and dynamic relaxation; it is appropriate for almost all ages regardless of physical condition. </h5> -->

        <!-- <h5 class="light"> Students achieve mind and body coordination, calmness, and centeredness through this training and apply these principles in individual and partner exercises. The qualities developed in these classes are demanded in Aikido practice and self-defense situations as well as in daily life.</h5> -->

<!--         Five Principles of Ki Breathing

        <li>Breathe out with the sound of HA, gradually and purposefully</li>

        <li>Exhale as calmly and quietly as possible</li>

        <li>At the end of each breath, Ki continues infinitely like a fading sound</li>

        <li>Inhale from the tip of your nose until your body feels saturated with breath</li>

        <li>After inhaling, calm your mind infinitely at the One-Point</li> -->
