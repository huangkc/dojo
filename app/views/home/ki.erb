        Being calm in daily life can often be the difference between performing well and performing poorly. In extreme situations, it can even be the difference between life and death.

        Ki meditation focuses our mind to the one point in the lower abdomen. When the one point is infinitely condensed by half, mind and body are unified and true calmness is obtained.

        In this state, are we able to effectively manage whatever complexities the world may offer us. <br><br></h5>
          
<!--         Five Principles of Ki Meditation

        <li>You maintain a posture of mastery</li>

        <li>You are letting go, releasing, and have a sense of freedom</li>

        <li>You create an atmosphere of harmony</li>

        <li>You are vividly aware of the spirit of life in Universe itself</li>

        <li>Therefore, you can feel the movement of the Ki of the Universe</li>

        <h5>    
        Breathing is something we all take for granted. Yet it is an experience we can not do without for more than a few minutes. To breathe properly is to breathe with mind and body unified.

        Just as breathing is essential to sustaining life, it is also essential to developing our Ki and life power. Ki breathing exercises, as designed by Tohei Sensei, are a central part of training and represents another opportunity to directly experience and realize for yourself the oneness of mind and body as well as your original connection to the Ki of the Universe. You are already One with the Universe.

        Even when tired, this method of breathing will quickly restore our energy. Ki breathing exercises are simple and can be performed in almost any situation.

<!--         Five Principles of Ki Breathing

        <li>Breathe out with the sound of HA, gradually and purposefully</li>

        <li>Exhale as calmly and quietly as possible</li>

        <li>At the end of each breath, Ki continues infinitely like a fading sound</li>

        <li>Inhale from the tip of your nose until your body feels saturated with breath</li>

        <li>After inhaling, calm your mind infinitely at the One-Point</li> -->
