The teaching lineage at ABC Aikido is a strong one, and it is easily traced back to the founder of the art, Ueishiba Morihei (O’Sensei).

At ABC Aikido, we work on developing the physical body through vigorous flowing practice as well as on calming the inner self through breathing and continued focus on one’s center. This results in connecting through motion.

We also believe in creating a positive energy within the local community by fostering cooperation, connectedness and use of non-aggressive means to resolve conflict. The emphasis of our martial arts practice is on “ki musubi” or the binding together of energy as opposed to resistance or clashing of energy.

ABC is a member of the United States Aikido Federation and is affiliated with and the Aikido World Headquarters at Hombu Dojo in Japan.
